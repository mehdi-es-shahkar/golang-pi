# golang-pi
this program caculate pi number in circle (3.14.........) with integral in golang language

To calculate the number pi in Python using integrals(This program calculates the approximate value of a definite integral using the Right Riemann Sum method.), we can consider a circle centered at the origin and with a radius of 1. The area of ​​a quarter of the circle is (1/4 * pi * 1 * 1). We can calculate the integral of the square root function (1 - x ** 2) between 0 and 1 and multiply by 4.
